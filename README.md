# SharkTrack

**SharkTrack** is a project that integrates **NASA satellite data, predictive modeling, and Smart Tags** to monitor shark movements and foraging habitats. 
Currently, the **interactive visualization platform and AI-powered explanations (LLM)** are implemented, while the Smart Tag and predictive Random Forest model remain conceptual.  

The platform allows users to explore shark movement patterns, overlay environmental variables such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration, and receive **AI-generated insights** about ecological dynamics.  

## Features

- Interactive map displaying shark locations and oceanographic data
- AI-generated explanations interpreting shark behavior and environmental patterns
- Conceptual design of **Smart Tags** for monitoring shark movements and feeding behavior
- Framework for **predictive modeling** of foraging habitats (planned, requires in-situ data)
